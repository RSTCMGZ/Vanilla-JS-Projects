            JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages.
            Developed in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and
            interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex
            actions. It also enables users to load content into a document
            without reloading the entire page.

            For an average learner with a good degree of discipline, it should
            take around seven to eight months to build up a working knowledge of
            CSS (and HTMLâ€”as they are almost inseparable). At the one-year mark,
            you'll have built up more confidence.
